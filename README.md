- 👋 Hi, I’m Hanny Rivera, a postdoctoral researcher at Boston University
- 👀 I’m interested in the genetic basis of environmental adaptation, especially in reef-building corals. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about coral physiological and genetic responses to increasing temperatures, and the genes involved in coral-algal symbioses. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 'omic projects, policy-focused data analyses, or conservation and environmental justice work. 
- 📫 How to reach me: hrivera at bu dot edu
